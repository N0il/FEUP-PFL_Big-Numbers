## Test Cases

## Functions Descriptions

- *1.1 fibRec*: this function takes one argument which is the index of the Fibonacci sequence we want to have calculated. It is implemented using a `naive recursive strategy`, calculating the value fib(n), by adding fib(n-1) + fib(n-2), aside from the base cases which are fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1;
